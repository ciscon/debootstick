# lintian false-positive:
# in scripts/create-image/functions, we define a shell alias for
# the keyword 'with'. This allows the following constructs:
# "with <rollback-able-cmd>; do <things>; done;"
# (similar to python's with statements)
# debootstick uses such a construct to rollback the
# host system to a sane state if an unexpected issue occurs.
